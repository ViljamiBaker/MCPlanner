This is a small project to make planning recipes in GTNH easier

Can only work by modifying Planner rn

To use TXT files:

create items and recipies in Input.txt

in this pattern

Create Item:item name
Create Recipe:# item name 1, # item name 2| # item name 3, # item name 4
or
Create Recipe:# item name
for base items

and call Calculate Item:item name # once

run IOHandler

look in output.txt

put SetIndent:whatever to set the indent or
NumberOfLinebreaks:number to set linebreaks between lines
